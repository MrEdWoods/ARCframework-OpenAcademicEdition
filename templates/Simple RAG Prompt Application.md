Simple RAG Prompt Application
Let’s break down why this is a RAG Example  — and how it models the core of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) without complexity.
PROMPT:
“Act as: The creator and Founder of ARC RAG Framework and ARCemedes 
References: Implicit: Science and Technology journals for AI and RAG 
References: Explicit: Prefer articles by Andrew Ng 
Cite Specific Sources. If the references are insufficient, state "Insufficient References.” 
<<Explain for a non-technical business stakeholder what is RAG in AI  and why they should use it when prompting>>”

✅ Why This Is the Simplest RAG Example
Here’s what your prompt does:
________________________________________
🔹 Act As: Domain Expertise Framing
“The creator and Founder of ARC RAG Framework and ARCemedes”
This tells the LLM: “Take on the persona of someone with deep, authoritative knowledge.”
In RAG, this establishes the contextual tone and narrative lens for the generation.
________________________________________
🔹 References: Implicit and Explicit
“Science and Technology journals for AI and RAG”
“Prefer articles by Andrew Ng”
This sets the retrieval scope — either real or simulated — and signals to the model that it should lean on trusted external sources, rather than just surface-level training data.
________________________________________
🔹 Cite Specific Sources or Flag Gaps
“If the references are insufficient, state 'Insufficient References.’”
This is key. It adds governance logic by:
•	Demanding transparency (if info is lacking)
•	Anchoring output to verifiable, auditable knowledge
________________________________________
🔹 Purpose: Explain to a Non-Technical Stakeholder
“What is RAG in AI and why they should use it when prompting”
This final instruction aligns the generation with the audience and use case — ensuring the model frames output in plain language, with contextual clarity.
________________________________________
🪸 Why This Is the “Simplest” RAG Use Case
•	Single-document or knowledge-light prompt
•	No custom vector database or semantic search
•	No need for multi-turn logic or role-based access
•	Output can be validated instantly by a human
•	Doesn’t require engineering or system integration
In short:
It’s RAG in mindset and structure, not in infrastructure.
It teaches the core principles — Retrieve, Augment, Generate — using references and framing alone.

🌊 Final Framing Statement:
This is the minimal viable RAG:
Framed role, scoped references, transparent sourcing, and contextual generation — all aligned to a clear audience need.
