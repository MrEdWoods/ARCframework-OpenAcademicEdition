📘 What Is the Curation Continuum?
The Curation Continuum is the bridge between information verification (Tier-1) and contextual adaptation (Tier-2).
It’s the discipline of moving AI outputs from “raw and referenced” to “relevant and ready.”

🌊 High-Level Flow
[ ACT AS ] → [ REFERENCE ] → [ CITE ]
   ↓
[ ANALYZE ] → [ REFRAME ] → [ COMMIT ]

✅ Tier-1: Validation & Rigor
The goal is epistemic grounding — making sure the AI knows what it’s talking about and backs it up.
Step	What It Ensures
Act As	AI mimics a credible domain authority
Reference	Information is pulled from reputable sources
Cite	Facts can be traced and verified
🛍️ Tier-1 Ask: “Is this accurate and grounded in real evidence?”

🔄 Transition: From Evidence to Action
The Curation Continuum ensures you don’t publish a prompt response just because it’s “true-ish.”
You curate the output for fit, readiness, and impact.

🧠 Tier-2: Decision-Making & Refinement
The goal is contextual intelligence — crafting answers that align with your people, purpose, and moment.
Step	What It Ensures
Analyze	Facts match the specific audience and use case
Reframe	Language, tone, and strategy are aligned
Commit	Output is approved, owned, and timed appropriately
🛍️ Tier-2 Ask: “Is this right for this moment, this audience, and this outcome?”

🪝 Practical Implementation Tip
Phase	Tool or Checklist	Goal
Prompt Draft	Tier-1 Checklist (Act As → Cite)	Factual integrity
Mid-review	ARC Compass Questions	Ethical and strategic pause
Finalization	Tier-2 Checklist (Analyze → Commit)	Operational readiness

🌟 ARC Golden Rule for the Curation Continuum
“Don’t just verify — contextualize.”
Don’t just contextualize — commit.
This mindset ensures your AI outputs move from raw data → validated insight → aligned action.
