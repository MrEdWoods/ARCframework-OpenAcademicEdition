## 🎯 Purpose & Value

This checklist activates **Tier-2 ARC Intelligence** for any **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflow.  
While Tier-2 ensures *factual grounding*, Tier-2 ensures the AI output is **appropriate, aligned, and actionable**.

> Tier-2 isn’t about whether the AI is correct — it’s about whether the answer is *relevant and ready* for the real world.

## 🏛️ Governance Mandate (Tier-2, Academic Edition)
In academic and organizational use of AI, Tier-2 is not just a stylistic filter—it is a contextual accountability checkpoint.

ARC Tier-2 ensures that even if AI-generated outputs are accurate, they are not misapplied, misaligned, or misleading in their audience, tone, or strategic intent.

Implementation of Tier-2 is recommended as part of narrative governance protocols, publication ethics reviews, and AI deployment checklists in any institutional or public-facing context.

## 🧭 ARC Tier-2: Analyze · Reframe · Commit

### 🔍 Analyze / Audit 
(Accuracy + Audit + Situational Relevance)

- **Source Match**: Are the retrieved sources current, complete, and relevant?  
- **Role & Scenario Fit**: Does it fit the actual use case (e.g. new hire vs. policy update)?  
- **Content Confidence**: Are key claims and data points accurate *and necessary*?

> ARC Tip: Contextualization starts by asking, *“Do the facts apply here and now — not just in general?”*

### ✍️ Reframe / Refine 
(Reliability + Narrative + Audience Alignment)

- **Audience Understanding**: Does it reflect your stakeholders’ literacy and priorities?  
- **Tone & Voice**: Does it match your org’s tone and emotional appropriateness?  
- **Narrative Fit**: Does it reinforce your org’s strategic direction?

> ARC Tip: Reframing ensures the output speaks the right truth — to the right people.

---

### ✅ Commit  
(Contextual Intent + Timing + Ownership)

- **Decision-Readiness**: Is it ready to publish or escalate?  
- **Lifecycle Awareness**: Is it timely for the project or campaign?  
- **Ownership**: Have responsible humans signed off?

> Commitment is when *context meets accountability*. You don’t just approve the message — you **own its impact**.

---

## 🔐 Ethical Layer (Optional but Recommended)

- **Bias & Inclusion Check**: Are language and assumptions inclusive?  
- **Privacy & Compliance**: Any risk of exposing sensitive data?  
- **Traceability**: Is the prompt, scope, and reviewer documented?

## 🧭 Final ARC Compass Review  
(*Reflective Pause before GO*)

> “Does this message reflect what we know, who we are, and what this moment needs?”

It’s your ethical checkpoint, narrative sanity check, and strategic alignment lens.

---

## 🚀 ARC GO!  
(*Decision Trigger*)

> “I’ve analyzed. I’ve reframed. I’m ready to commit.”  
Now you GO — with **intentional momentum**.

📌 Purpose: ARC GO! moves you from theory into safe, tested execution, refining AI in the real world—not in a vacuum.

## 🌟 ARC Golden Rule

> “Don’t just generate — **contextualize**.”

This principle threads through every ARC workflow. It transforms AI from a response engine to a **relevance engine**.
