# ✅ ARC Tier-1 Governance Validation Checklist (Open Academic Edition)

> 🧠 ARC Framework Tier-1  
> 🎯 Focus: Factual Grounding & Source Traceability  
> 📁 Use Case: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) — Pre-Contextual Review

---

## 🎯 Purpose 
Tier-1 validation ensures that AI-generated content is factually accurate, properly sourced, and grounded in domain expertise before any contextual or narrative adaptation (which happens in Tier-2).

This is the “Truth Checkpoint” — the moment we ask:
“Is this true, and where’s the proof?”

## 🏛️ Governance Mandate (Academic Edition)
In academic and research institutions, ARC Tier-1 is intended not merely as a quality control tool, but as a governance requirement—a formal checkpoint in AI and data use to ensure epistemic integrity, source traceability, and ethical accountability.

Implementation of this checklist is recommended as part of institutional governance frameworks, ethics boards, or research approval pipelines when AI models, automated systems, or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) are involved

## 🧭 ARC Tier-1: Act As · Reference · Cite

### 1️⃣ **Act As Alignment**  
- [ ] Is the AI response shaped by a **relevant domain authority**?  
- [ ] Does the prompt establish a credible role (e.g., “Act as an oncologist”, “Act as Andrew Ng”)?  
- [ ] Is the persona consistent with the domain's best practices?

> ARC Tip: "Act As" is your **epistemic anchor** — it defines the worldview the AI draws from.

---

### 2️⃣ **Reference Integrity**

- [ ] Are **explicit references** (e.g., journal names, URLs) included?  
- [ ] Are **implicit references** (e.g., known domain facts) appropriate for the subject?  
- [ ] Are the sources **current, reputable, and accessible** (e.g., PubMed, arXiv, government sites)?  
- [ ] Are retrieved documents *relevant to the specific prompt*, not just similar topics?

---

### 3️⃣ **Citation Traceability**

- [ ] Can each **claim** be traced to a specific source or document?  
- [ ] Are quotations or paraphrased segments **clearly marked**?  
- [ ] Are in-text citations or footnotes included when available?  
- [ ] Is there **no hallucination** (i.e., fabricated names, links, or claims)?

> ARC Tip: If a human reviewer can’t verify it — it doesn’t pass Tier-1.

## 🧪 Final Tier-1 Confidence Check

| Question                                    | Yes / No |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Does the output reflect domain authority?  |          |
| Are references explicit, reputable, and relevant? |     |
| Can each claim be verified from a real source? |         |
| Is hallucination risk mitigated?           |          |

## 🌟 ARC Golden Rule — Tier-1 Version

> “Don’t just cite — verify.”

ARC Tier-1 is about **trustworthy knowledge grounding**. It ensures AI doesn’t just sound smart — it *is* smart, backed by real data.
