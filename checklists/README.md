# 📂 ARC Governance Validation Checklists (Open Academic Edition)

This directory contains open academic editions of the ARC Framework’s Tier-1 and Tier-2 governance validation checklists. These tools support ethical, accurate, and context-aware use of AI in academic and organizational settings.

---

## 📘 Tier-1 — Factual Validation & Source Integrity

**File:** `ARC_Tier-1_Governance_Validation_Checklist_(Open_Academic_Edition).md`

🔹 *Focus: Truth-checking, citation traceability, domain authority verification*
🔹 *Use this before applying AI content contextually or narratively*

Tier-1 acts as your “Truth Checkpoint.” It ensures AI-generated outputs are:

* Grounded in real data
* Explicitly and accurately sourced
* Free from hallucinations or epistemic drift

---

## 📙 Tier-2 — Contextual Alignment & Strategic Readiness

**File:** `ARC_Tier-2_Governance_Validation_Checklist_(Open_Academic_Edition).md`

🔸 *Focus: Audience fit, ethical voice, organizational alignment*
🔸 *Use this to reframe or approve AI outputs before action or publication*

Tier-2 is your “Relevance Checkpoint.” It ensures AI content:

* Aligns with your stakeholders’ needs and literacy
* Matches institutional tone, timing, and impact
* Reflects responsible narrative ownership

## ✅ How to Use This Directory

Use both checklists in sequence as part of an **AI governance pipeline**:

1. **Tier-1** confirms the **truth** of AI content.
2. **Tier-2** ensures its **relevance, tone, and decision-readiness**.
3. When both pass, trigger the **ARC GO!** phase for ethical deployment.

> 📌 Together, these tiers prevent AI misuse and promote academically and ethically rigorous outputs.
