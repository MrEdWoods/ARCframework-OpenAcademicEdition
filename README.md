## 🔍 What Is the ARC Framework?

The ARC Framework helps humans interact with AI in a way that ensures:

- **Accuracy** – Verifiable, fact-based outputs
- **Reliability** – Traceable reasoning and source transparency
- **Contextuality** – Human-aligned goals, roles, and relevance

Together, these three pillars form the foundation of **epistemically responsible AI use**.
